Given Q = 4 pi sin(theta)/lambda, the resolution in Q is determined by
the dispersion angle theta and wavelength lambda.  For monochromatic
sources, the wavelength resolution is fixed and the angular resolution
varies.  For polychromatic sources, the wavelength resolution varies and
the angular resolution is fixed.

The angular resolution is determined by the geometry (slit positions and
openings and sample profile) with perhaps an additional contribution
from sample warp.  For monochromatic instruments, measurements are taken
with fixed slits at low angles until the beam falls completely onto the
sample.  Then as the angle increases, slits are opened to preserve full
illumination.  At some point the slit openings exceed the beam width,
and thus they are left fixed for all angles above this threshold.

When the sample is tiny, stray neutrons miss the sample and are not
reflected onto the detector.  This results in a resolution that is
tighter than expected given the slit openings.  If the sample width
is available, we can use that to determine how much of the beam is
intercepted by the sample, which we then use as an alternative second
slit.  This simple calculation isn't quite correct for very low Q, but
in that case both reflected and transmitted neutrons will arrive at the
detector, so the computed resolution of dQ=0 at Q=0 is good enough.

When the sample is warped, it may act to either focus or spread the
incident beam.  Some samples are diffuse scatters, which also acts
to spread the beam.  The degree of spread can be estimated from the
full-width at half max (FWHM) of a rocking curve at known slit settings.
The expected FWHM will be (s1+s2) / (2*(d_s1-d_s2)).  The difference
between this and the measured FWHM is the sample_broadening value.
A second order effect is that at low angles the warping will cast
shadows, changing the resolution and intensity in very complex ways.

For polychromatic time of flight instruments, the wavelength dispersion
is determined by the reduction process, which bins different time
channels between fastest and slowest, usually in a way that sets a
fixed relative resolution dL/L for each bin.

Usage
=====
**resolution** module defines two instrument types:
:class:`Monochromatic` and :class:`Polychromatic`.  These represent
generic scanning and time of flight instruments, respectively.  In
addition, instruments at SNS and NCNR have many of their parameters
predefined in :mod:`snsdata` and :mod:`ncnrdata`.

To perform a simulation or load a data set, an actual instrument must
be created.  For example:

.. doctest::

    >>> from resolution import Monochromatic
    >>> instrument = Monochromatic(
            # instrument parameters
            instrument = "AND/R",
            radiation = "neutron",
            wavelength = 5.0042,
            dLoL=0.009,
            d_s1 = 230.0 + 1856.0,
            d_s2 = 230.0,
            # measurement parameters
            Tlo=0.5, slits_at_Tlo=0.2, slits_below=0.1,
            )

An instrument such as this can be used to compute a resolution function
for arbitrary Q values, following the slit opening pattern defined by
the instrument.

    >>> resolution = instrument.resolution(T=linspace(0, 5, 51)

The resolution object *resolution* is of :class:`Resolution`.  Using it
you can compute the resolution *dQ* for a given *Q* based on *T*, *dT*,
*L*, and *dL*.  Furthermore, it can easily be turned into a reflectometry
probe for use in modeling::

    >>> probe = resolution.probe()

Since creating the reflectometry probe is the usual case, a couple of
driver functions are provided.  For example, the following complete
example loads and plots two data files:

.. doctest::

    >>> import pylab
    >>> from ncnrdata import ANDR
    >>> instrument = ANDR(Tlo=0.5, slits_at_Tlo=0.2, slits_below=0.1)
    >>> probe1 = instrument.load('blg117.refl')
    >>> probe2 = instrument.load('blg126.refl')
    >>> probe1.plot()
    >>> probe2.plot()
    >>> pylab.show()

Generating a simulation probe is similarly convenient:

.. doctest::

    >>> from ncnrdata import ANDR
    >>> instrument = ANDR(Tlo=0.5, slits_at_Tlo=0.2, slits_below=0.1)
    >>> probe = instrument.simulate(T=np.arange(0, 5, 100))

and for magnetic systems in polarized beam::

    >>> probe = instrument.simulate_magnetic(T=np.arange(0, 5, 100))

When loading or simulating a data set, any of the instrument parameters
and measurement geometry information can be specified, replacing the
defaults within the instrument.  For example, to include sample broadening
effects in the resolution::

    >>> from ncnrdata import ANDR
    >>> instrument = ANDR(Tlo=0.5, slits_at_Tlo=0.2, slits_below=0.1)
    >>> probe1 = instrument.load('blg117.refl', sample_broadening=0.1)

Properties of the instrument can be displayed::

    >>> print(ANDR.defaults())
    >>> print(instrument.defaults())

    Attributes                          Description
    ==================================  ==================================================================
    *instrument*                        name of the instrument

    *wavelength* (Angstrom)             wavelength of the instrument
    *dLoL*                              constant relative wavelength dispersion; wavelength range and

    *slits_at_Tlo* (mm)                 slit 1 and slit 2 openings at Tlo; this can be a scalar if both
                                        slits are open by the same amount, otherwise it is a pair (s1, s2).
    *slits_below*, *slits_above*        slit 1 and slit 2 openings below Tlo and above Thi; again, these
                                        can be scalar if slit 1 and slit 2 are the same, otherwise they
                                        are each a pair (s1, s2). Below and above default to the values of
                                        the slits at Tlo and Thi respectively.
    *Tlo*, *Thi* (degrees)              range of opening slits, or inf if slits are fixed.
    *sample_width* (mm)                 width of sample; at low angle with tiny samples, stray neutrons
                                        miss the sample and are not reflected onto the detector, so the
                                        sample itself acts as a slit, therefore the width of the sample

    *sample_broadening* (degrees FWHM)  amount of angular divergence (+) or focusing (-) introduced by
                                        the sample; this is caused by sample warp, and may be read off
                                        of the rocking curve by subtracting (s1+s2)/2/(d_s1-d_s2) from
                                        the FWHM width of the rocking curve.
    ==================================  ==================================================================

These parameters should be available in the reduced data file, or they
can be found in the raw NeXus file.

GUI Usage
=========

Graphical user interfaces follow different usage patterns from scripts.
Here the emphasis will be on selecting a data set to process, displaying
its default metadata and allowing the user to override it.

File loading should follow the pattern established in reflectometry
reduction, with an extension registry and a fallback scheme whereby
files can be checked in a predefined order.  If the file cannot be
loaded, then the next loader is tried.  This should be extended with
the concept of a magic signature such as those used by graphics and
sound file applications: preread the first block and run it through
the signature check before trying to load it.  For unrecognized extensions,
all loaders can be tried.

The file loader should return an instrument instance with metadata
initialized from the file header.  This metadata can be displayed
to the user along with a plot of the data and the resolution.  When
metadata values are changed, the resolution can be recomputed and the
display updated.  When the data is accepted, the final resolution
calculation can be performed.

Calculations
============

Resolution in Q is computed from uncertainty in wavelength L and angle T
using propogation of errors::

    dQ**2 = (df/dL)**2 dL**2 + (df/dT)**2 dT**2

where::

    f(L, T) = 4 pi sin(T)/L
    df/dL = -4 pi sin(T)/L**2 = -Q/L
    df/dT = 4 pi cos(T)/L = (4 pi sin(T) / L) / (sin(T)/cos(T)) = Q/tan(T)

yielding the traditional form::

    (dQ/Q)**2 = (dL/L)**2 + (dT/tan(T))**2

Computationally, 1/tan(T) is infinity at T=0, so it is better to use the
direct calculation::

    dQ = (4 pi / L) sqrt( sin(T)**2 (dL/L)**2 + cos(T)**2 dT**2 )


Wavelength dispersion dL/L is usually constant (e.g., for AND/R it is 2%
FWHM), but it can vary on time-of-flight instruments depending on how the
data is binned.

Angular divergence dT comes primarily from the slit geometry, but can have
broadening or focusing due to a warped sample.  The slit contribution is
dT = (s1+s2)/(2d) FWHM  where s1, s2 are slit openings and d is the distance
between slits.  For tiny samples, the sample itself can act as a slit.
If s_sample = sin(T)*w is smaller than s2 for some T, then use
dT = (s1+s_sample)/(2(d+d_sample)) instead.

The sample broadening can be read off a rocking curve as  w - (s1+s2)/(2d)
where w is the measured FWHM of the peak. This constant should be added to
the computed dT for all angles and slit geometries.  You will not
usually have this information on hand, but you can leave space for users
to enter it if it is available.

FWHM can be converted to 1-sigma resolution using the scale factor of
1/sqrt(8 * log(2))

For opening slits, dT/T is held constant, so if you know s and To at the
start of the opening slits region you can compute dT/To, and later scale
that to your particular T::

    dT(Q) = dT/To * T(Q)

Because d is fixed, that means s1(T) = s1(To) * T/To and s2(T) = s2(To) * T/To
