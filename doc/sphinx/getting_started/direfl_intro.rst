DiRefl - An Overview
######################################################

Direct Inversion Reflectometry (DiRefl) applies phase reconstruction and direct 
inversion techniques to analyze the reflectivity datasets produced by the two
neutron scattering experiments performed on a single or multi-layer sample 
sandwiched between incident and substrate layers whose characteristics are known.
The only setup difference between the runs is that the user changes the material
of one of the surrounding layers. Output from DiRefl is in the form of a SLD 
profile graph and other supporting plots that can be saved or printed. In 
addition, the user can load, edit, and save model information, load 
reflectometry datasets, and adjust several parameters that affect the 
qualitative results of the analysis.
