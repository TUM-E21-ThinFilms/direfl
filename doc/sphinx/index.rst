The Direct Inversion Reflectometry (DiRefl) application generates a scattering length density (SLD) profile
of a thin film or free form sample using two neutron scattering datasets without the need to perform a fit 
of the data. DiRefl also has a simulation capability for creating datasets from a simple model description
of the sample material.
