KsRefl is a reflectometry fitting program for neutron and X-ray data.
It currently supports 1-D profiles, with mixed flat and spline layers for
magnetic and non-magnetic systems.

You are installing an Alpha release of the software.  KsRefl is in active
development with more features and performance improvements to come.
The application is written almost entirely in Python and utilizes a few
functions coded in C.
