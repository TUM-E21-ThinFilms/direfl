This is the top-level directory of the inversion package.

From this directory, setup.py, setup_py2exe.py, or the application direfl.py
can be run.  However, to execute the master_builder.py script, a root directory
must exist as the parent of this directory.  The root can have any name and the
build script should be copied to it and run from there.

The directory layout after running master_builder.py is:

<root>                  : copy master_builder.py here & run to build everything
|-- <builder output>    : windows installer, source zip, copy of pdf, etc files
|-- inversion           : top-level of package
|   |-- api             : modules that implement the api
|   |-- build           : created by running setup.py
|   |-- common          : modules for common code, constants, configuration info
|   |-- dist            : created by running setup_py2exe and used by Inno Setup
|   |-- data            : example data files
|   |-- doc             : sphinx files used to build html and pdf documentation
|   |-- gui             : modules that implement the gui
|   |-- tests           : modules for testing
|   `-- xtras           : ancillary files kept in the repository for convenience
`-- local-site-packages : created by running master_builder.py
    `-- inversion       : package installed locally in this directory tree ...
        |-- api
        |-- common
        |-- data
        |-- doc
        |   `-- sphinx
        |       `-- _build  : subdirectories contain html and pdf files
        |-- gui
        `-- tests

Plus an .svn directory is created in every source directory or subdirectory
when an 'svn checkout' operation is performed.
